# Implementation Log

## Phase 0 - D3D12 bootstrap (2025-10-12)
- Added DirectX helper headers (d3dx12*) and updated the atlas backend to include them.
- Refactored BackendD3D12 quad geometry into persistent resources and aligned the shader/input layout semantics.
- Outstanding work: Windows-only UltraPerformance build, shader compilation validation, and runtime smoke test on a machine with the D3D12 toolchain.
- Authored feature-maximization roadmap covering DirectStorage, VRS, mesh shaders, vendor integrations, and cross-backend fallbacks (`docs/RENDERER_FEATURE_MAX_PLAN.md`, `docs/RENDERER_FEATURE_MATRIX.md`, `docs/RENDERER_BUILD_VALIDATION.md`).
- Modularized shader common code into reusable components (`shaders/hlsl/common`) and added `tools/Invoke-DXCBuild.ps1` for DXC-based compilation.
- Expanded D3D12 descriptor schema, added feature-tier detection (VRS, mesh shader, sampler feedback), and wired a DirectStorage manager stub into the backend for upcoming GPU-IO work.
- Hooked the DXC build script into MSBuild, added shader output include paths, and exposed queue/fence infrastructure (graphics/compute/copy) with runtime toggles for VRS/Sampler Feedback in `BackendD3D12`.
- Built out `DirectStorageManager` with runtime loading, queue creation, request enqueuing, and integrated status reporting within `BackendD3D12`, including an optional glyph-atlas streaming path.
- Instrumented DirectStorage telemetry events, documented 9P staging strategy, and introduced vendor extension scaffolding (NVAPI/AGS detection) plus SPIR-V/GLSL build outputs to prepare the OpenGL backends.
- Added the initial `BackendOpenGL.cpp` implementation that consumes the shared SPIR-V/GLSL shader artifacts and mirrors the D3D12 quad batching setup.
