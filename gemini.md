# Gemini Audit & Harmonized Roadmap for Windows Terminal Optimized

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive audit of the `windows-terminal-optimized` repository. It analyzes the existing code, documentation, and the "Ultra-Riced Terminal Master Plan" to identify the current state of the project, including what is implemented ("wired up") and where there are gaps.

The primary goal of this document is to harmonize the project's ambitious goals with the current reality of the codebase, and to provide a clear, "ultra-granular," and actionable roadmap to achieve the vision of a high-performance, aesthetically pleasing, and feature-rich Windows Terminal.

## 2. Repository Audit & Analysis

### 2.1. High-Level Summary

The repository is a fork of the official Windows Terminal, with a clear focus on performance and aesthetics. The project is built on a C++ foundation and leverages technologies like DirectWrite and WIL. The core components are the Windows Terminal itself, the Console Host, and a set of shared components.

The presence of numerous documentation files, including a detailed "Ultra-Riced Terminal Master Plan," indicates a strong vision for the project.

### 2.2. "Ultra-Riced" Master Plan Analysis

The `ULTRA_RICED_TERMINAL_MASTER_PLAN.md` is the cornerstone of this project. It outlines a 14-week plan to create a "riced" version of the terminal with the following key features:

*   **D3D12 Renderer:** A new, high-performance renderer based on DirectX 12.
*   **SIMD Optimizations:** Leveraging x86-64-v3 instructions for faster text processing.
*   **OpenGL Fallback:** An OpenGL 3.3+ renderer for broader compatibility.
*   **Themes & Fonts:** A curated set of 11 themes and modern fonts, including Nerd Fonts.

The plan is exceptionally detailed, with specific implementation phases, code examples, and performance targets.

### 2.3. Implementation Status (Wired Up vs. Gaps)

A detailed analysis of the repository against the "Ultra-Riced" master plan reveals the following:

**Wired Up:**

*   **Themes:** All 11 themes outlined in the master plan have been integrated into `src/cascadia/TerminalSettingsModel/defaults.json`.
*   **Fonts:** The "Spline Sans Mono" and "Spline Sans" font families have been added to the `fonts` directory.
*   **Build Configuration:** The `src/common.build.ultraperformance.props` file, which contains the aggressive optimization flags for the x86-64-v3 build, is present and correctly configured.

**Gaps:**

*   **D3D12 Renderer:** The `src/renderer/atlas-d3d12` directory and all related files for the new DirectX 12 renderer are absent.
*   **OpenGL Fallback:** The `src/renderer/opengl33` directory and all related files for the OpenGL fallback renderer are also missing.

## 3. Development Conventions

### 3.1. Header File Conventions (.h vs. .hpp)

The project currently uses a mix of `.h` and `.hpp` header file extensions. Here is a summary of the convention we will follow:

*   **.h:** This extension will be used for C-style headers and for headers that are shared with C code. This is the traditional approach and ensures maximum compatibility.
*   **.hpp:** This extension will be used for C++-specific headers, especially those that contain templates or other C++-only features. This convention helps to clearly distinguish C++ code from C code.
*   **Consistency:** When modifying existing files, the existing file extension will be maintained to ensure consistency.

This convention respects the project's history while providing a clear path forward for new code.

## 4. Project Plan & Roadmap

This section serves as my "planner" for the project. It breaks down the full roadmap into a granular, todolist-style format. I will keep this section updated as we make progress.

### Phase 1: Foundation (Done)

**Goal:** Solidify the project's foundation by addressing all remaining gaps from the initial setup.

*   [**Done**] **Task 1.1:** Add the "Cascadia Code Nerd Font" to the `fonts` directory.
*   [**Done**] **Task 1.2:** Add the "Spline Sans" and "Spline Sans Mono" fonts to the `fonts` directory and include their licenses.
*   [**Done**] **Task 1.3:** Create the `src/types/CpuFeatures.cpp` and `src/types/CpuFeatures.h` files and implement the CPU feature detection logic.
*   [**Done**] **Task 1.4:** Integrate the CPU feature detection into the build process by creating a sample SIMD-optimized function and calling it at startup.
*   [**Done**] **Task 1.5:** Create a new build configuration in Visual Studio named "UltraPerformance" that utilizes the `common.build.ultraperformance.props` file.

### Phase 2: D3D12 Renderer (In Progress)

**Goal:** Implement the high-performance D3D12 renderer.

*   [**Done**] **Task 2.1:** Create the `src/renderer/atlas-d3d12` directory.
*   [**Done**] **Task 2.2:** Implement the D3D12 device and swap chain management.
*   [**In Progress**] **Task 2.3:** Port the glyph atlas system from the existing D3D11 renderer to the new D3D12 renderer.
    *   [**Done**] Port the `TextAnalysisSource` and `TextAnalysisSink` classes.
    *   [**Done**] Port the main glyph processing pipeline methods (`_flushBufferLine`, `_mapRegularText`, `_mapBuiltinGlyphs`, `_mapCharacters`, `_mapComplex`).
    *   [**Done**] Port the `Settings` struct and related settings classes.
    *   [**Done**] Port the `FontCache` class and related font loading methods.
    *   [**In Progress**] Fill in the implementation of the glyph processing methods.
*   [**To Do**] **Task 2.4:** Implement the Alacritty-style batch rendering with an instance buffer.
*   [**To Do**] **Task 2.5:** Create a new `RenderEngine` implementation for the D3D12 renderer and integrate it into the terminal's rendering pipeline.

### Phase 3: SIMD Optimizations (To Do)

**Goal:** Implement SIMD optimizations for key text processing functions.

*   [**To Do**] **Task 3.1:** Implement AVX2-optimized UTF-8/UTF-16 conversion functions.
